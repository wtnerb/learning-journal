# Code 201 day 13
## Code review, local storage

##### Code review
Today my code was reviewed. I learned mostly that I needed to make better use of loops when I'm seeing repetitive code. Fair enough, that does seem like a foul code smell.

##### Local storage
Local storage is a way to use the end user's computer memory to store some information. This is especially useful for persistence across different pages in the same website. It can be access and manipulated in a few ways, but my preference is for the localStorage object. Partially because intellisense will then suggest properties/methods and that makes me less prone to mistakes.
