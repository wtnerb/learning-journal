##DOM and Problem Domain

#####DOM
This was really cool. Finding out how to dynamically update the webpage is critical. It can make things so much more flexible. I mean, I knew there had to be a way to do things like this. Actually knowing it is this simple is great! Honestly, coding is beginning to remind me a bit of math: there are two kinds of problems -- simple ones you know how to solve and impossibly difficult ones you don't.

#####Problem Domain
I guess I see the importance, knowing what you are trying to do before you try is important. Just like visualizing before performing a physical task helps do it smoothly the first time. That said, I have some difficulty seeing how structing things in a user story really helps. Why does "as a user, I want the interface to be intuitive" work better than "the interface should be intuitive." The second option seems to cut out unnecessary clutter.
