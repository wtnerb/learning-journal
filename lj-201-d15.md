## Merge conflicts

##### Merge conflicts
Up until this point, Scott had asked us to come to him if we had merge conflicts. Today, we made our own merge conflicts on purpose. Resolving them was strange but doable. Git really does make it clear when thing might conflict and make sure that you only screw things up on purpose. The more I find out about git the more useful it seems. I had thought git was overblown and largely a convention. I stand corrected.
