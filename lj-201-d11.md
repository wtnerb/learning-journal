The biggest challenge with today's code was finding a way to actually capture which element got clicked in the triggering event. With some playing around in the console, and use of console.log(event), I did eventually find a solution. It turned out to be embarassingly simple. Go figure. In the meantime, I found out that do {} while () statements work in javascript! I've used them in my tiny history in C before, and I figured I'd just give it a shot in JS. It worked exactly like I expected. I wonder what other features of JS I haven't had a chance to explore yet ....
