## Events and Forms

##### Forms
Forms seems simple at first. They are special html elements that accept user input. I can understand now why Brian, in day 2(3?) when he covered for Scott, said that the whole internet is just a bunch of forms. It makes sense.

##### Events
Events is a fancy way (As best I can tell) of talking about user input. And input is an event. And since a given website only cares about certain types of events, developers add event listeners to listen for useful events. This makes sense. Although it kind of feels like black magic right now. Also there was a thing about a function callback that I should dig into more when I have time.
