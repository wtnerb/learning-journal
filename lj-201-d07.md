## Prototypes, tables

##### Tables
Tables were discussed in the Kahn Academy prework, as were constructor functions. I'd love to say that all of that was new to me, but it really isn't.

##### Prototypes
Using prototype is new. In particular, I didn't know that each object takes up space with the methods attatched to it, while prototypes lets objects reach to the prototype when a method is called. The concept is clean and clever. Although I am somewhat confused why the interpreter doesn't just put methods in the constructor onto a prototype to save memory. Ah well, it is what it is.
