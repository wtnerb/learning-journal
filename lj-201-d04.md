## Css layout, pair programming

##### CSS layout
This helps the box layout model make a lot more sense. If you can manipulate boxes like this, then you can build all sorts of cool things. Still seems like a strange approach to building a webpage, but I guess with familiarity it will make more sense.

##### pair programming
We were told how pair programming works, and made to do it today. That said, pair programming feels wrong. I think part of the problem is that I'm familiar with some of these fundamentals (functions, variables, etc) while my partner for the day (no, I will not name names!) clearly was not familiar with those ideas. As a result, pair programming fell quickly into a pattern reminiscent of my time tutoring college students. Perhaps when dealing with someone who is on a equivalent level to me it will make sense. Right now its mildly annoying.
