##Canvas, chart JS, return, map

#####Canvas
So, it is good to know that the thing Kahn Academy used was the canvas element. Now I can build by own version of the kahn academy playground! Although I won't. But I could! Probably. This also sounds like a great way to build a thing with more freedom than the DOM easily permits. Like, say, a graph, to choose a completely random example.

#####Chart JS
Turns out that using libraries is even simplier than I thought. I was expecting libraries to be a bit more complicated to implement. I can see why they are so widespread if this is all I need to use them.

#####Return
I noticed a bug in Scott's live code (allowed duplicates in busmall) and his fix taught something interesting -- return statements end a function call. So if I want to end a function call early under certain conditions, use an if statement and have in that block a return. Good to know.

#####map
In today's lab, the chart required an array of numbers for the graph. I figured there had to be a quick way to turn an array of objects with a property into just an array of the values of that property. Some google searching turned up the array.map() method. It worked like a charm when I copy pasted it. Then I went home and used MDN to dig deeper. Map is an easy way to apply a simple transformation on each element in an array. This is cool! I wonder what other methods like this I might be able to dig up.
