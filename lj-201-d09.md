#Code 201 day 09
##CSS styleguides, layout, wireframe

Honestly, everything about today is the stuff that I don't really enjoy but need to master to call myself a fullstack dev. That said, I'd rather deal with challenging Javascript logic anyday.

#####Style guides
Probably the biggest thing for me today was the websites that help you pick a color scheme and thing of that nature. I do not have the eye of an artist, having those sorts of tools will be invaluable if I ever make an independent website.

#####Layout
The grid system/columns makes sense. I can see why people do it. However, since I haven't built my own column based website I'm not sure I'll ever get a great grasp on the execution rather than simply the conceptual ideas.

#####Wireframe
Thank goodness. Having a designer write up a wireframe and style guide would be fantastic. These sorts of things could make front end web development palatable for me. It's nice to know I'll have that option.
