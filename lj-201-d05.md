# Code 201 day 05
## Branches, Css text, info sources

##### Branches
we did more practice on branches today. It got tedious really quickly, but I guess I can see the point. If branches really do protect the working code as much as advertised, then using them should be second nature. I just wish getting to that point of second nature was a bit less tedious. Alas, the human condition strikes again.

##### CSS text
The text manipulations in CSS seem simple and straight forward, but I guess they are fairly fundamental to website design. I really don't enjoy CSS, however. It is quickly becoming my least favorite part of web development.

##### Info Sources
We actually discussed this earlier, but since it was on the github page for today it seems appropriate to discuss it here. The basic idea is which docs to trust -- namely, MDN, StackOverflow and W3schools. Namely, that MDN is great for reading docs and say, trying to figure out how this thing works (EDIT 2018.01.28 yes. This is how I learned to use things like arrow functions, methods like map, reduce, split, join, and language features like codition?expression:expression. I saw these things on code wars and then went to MDN to understand how they work. Now I can use them in my own code. It is great!) Also, stackOverflow is great for answering specific questions. A reasonable way of looking at it is StackOverflow is like asking an instructor or visiting a FAQ. MDN is like reading the textbook to really get all the details about the material.
