##Linters, branches, and box model

#####Linters
Linters are really cool. One of the most frustrating things for me when doing code in the past is stupid little details -- forgetting a semicolon in C is really frustrating for a new programmer. Linters are made to be able to catch those sorts of things (also, linters help correct style issues so that code across a single team looks professional. That's cool and all, but less relateable to my own past experiences.)

#####Branches
The more I learn about git, the more I like it. It seems kind of strange, at first, but I know I have made additions to code before that caused things to break horribly. Especially when I'm trying to refactor and clean a barely functional mess that I produced earlier. With branching, I can have the confidence to make those much needed fixes without worring about breaking anything permanently. It is great!

#####Box model
Honestly, I'm already half convinced I don't want to do much front end development, but the box model is interesting. It seems really limiting, but lots of cools websites have been built using it. I'll have to play with it a bit before I can really say more.
