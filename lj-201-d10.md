## Debugging

##### Debugging
... Now you tell me how to use the debugger tool? Arg.

Honestly, up to this point I've been working with simple enough applications that console.log() was sufficient. Well, combined with the ability to copy/paste code into the console and probe it like only a scripting language can.

The debugger is extremely useful, however. Especially as I move on to more and more advanced code and details of what I'm trying to accomplish.
